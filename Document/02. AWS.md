### AWS Well-Architected Framework
When architecting technology solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS), if you neglect the five pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization, it can become challenging to build a system that delivers on your expectations and requirements.
  - **Operational Excellence**
    - Perform operations as code
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    - Refine operations procedures frequently
    - Anticipate failure
    - Learn from all operational failures
  - **Security**
    - Implement a strong identity foundation
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply security at all layers
    - Automate security best practices
    - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Keep people away from data
    - Prepare for security events
  - **Reliability**
    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation
  - **Performance Efficiency**
    - Democratize advanced technologies
    - Go global in minutes
    - Use serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Consider mechanical sympathy
  - **Cost Optimization**
    - Implement cloud financial management
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure
