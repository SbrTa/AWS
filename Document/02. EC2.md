# EC2 / ECC / Elastic Compute Cloud

## EC2
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service with which you can run virtual server “instances” in the cloud. EC2 instances can run the Windows, Linux, or MacOS operating systems. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.

#### Benefits of EC2
  - **Elastic Web-Scale computing** – you can increase or decrease capacity within minutes not hours and commission one to thousands of instances simultaneously.
  - **Completely controlled** – You have complete control include root access to each instance and can stop and start instances without losing data and using web service APIs.
  - **Flexible Cloud Hosting Services** – you can choose from multiple instance types, operating systems, and software packages as well as instances with varying memory, CPU and storage configurations.
  - **Integrated** – EC2 is integrated with most AWS services such as S3, RDS, and VPC to provide a complete, secure solution.
  - **Reliable** – EC2 offers a highly reliable environment where replacement instances can be rapidly and predictably commissioned with SLAs of 99.99% for each region.
  - **Secure** – EC2 works in conjunction with VPC to provide a secure location with an IP address range you specify and offers Security Groups, Network ACLs, and IPSec VPN features.
  - **Inexpensive** – Amazon passes on the financial benefits of scale by charging very low rates and on a capacity consumed basis.

#### EC2 Instance types
Each EC2 instance type is grouped under an instance family. Instance types offer different combinations of storage, memory, processing power.
  - General purpose (Balanced resources: Web servers/code repository)
  - Computer optimized (Compute intensive tasks: Gaming servers, high performance computing - HPC, Scientific modeling, batch processing)
  - Memory optimized (Memory intensive tasks)
  - Accelerated computing (Floating point number calculations, Graphics processing, Data pattern matching, hardware accelerators)
  - Storage optimized (High performance for locally stored data)
  - etc ...
