# Working with Streams and Lambda expressions

## Lambda
- Lambda expression: an anonymous method
- Functional programming: passing code as data
- Lambda expression helps to use functional programming in java
- Lambda expression always implements functional interface.
- Functional interfaces: java.util.function
- Lambda expression structure
```
    parameters -> body
   
    - parameter
        - parameter type is optional
        - no parameter: empty parentheses [ () -> body ]
        - single parameter: parentheses are optional [ (p) -> body ] [ p -> body ]
        - multiple parameter: parentheses required [ (p,q) -> body ]
    - body  
        - body can be block or single expression
        - for single expression, no return needed
        - for block, return is required [ () -> { statement1; statement2; return something; } ] 
```
- lambda expression can access final or effectively final variable
- effectively final variable means a variable that was assigned only once and not modified inside or outside lambda expression
- but for mutable object like arraylist we can use and modify the object inside or outside lambda


## Functional interface
- functional interface must have single abstract method
- can have static method, default method and inherited method from Object class
- ```@FunctionalInterface``` annotation is used to declare an interface function. but it's optional. if an interface contains single abstract method, then it is functional.
- if you use ```@FunctionalInterface``` in an interface, you can't write multiple abstract method. compiler will throw error.
- commonly used functional interfaces
```
    public interface Function<T, R> {
        R apply(T t);   // 1 input 1 output
    }
    
    public interface BiFunction<T, U, R> {
        R apply(T t, U u);  // 2 input 1 output
    }
    
    public interface Consumer<T> {
        void accept(T t);   // 1 input 0 output
    }
    
    public interface BiConsumer<T, U> {
        void accept(T t, U u);  // 2 input 0 output
    }
    
    public interface Supplier<T> {
        T get();    // 0 input 1 output
    }
    
    public interface Predicate<T> {
        boolean test(T t);  // 1 input 1 boolean output
    }
    
    public interface BiPredicate<T, U> {
        boolean test(T t, U u); // 2 input 1 boolean output
    }
    
    public interface UnaryOperator<T> extends Function<T, T> {
        T apply(T t);   // 1 input 1 output - same type
    }
    
    public interface BinaryOperator<T> extends BiFunction<T,T,T> {
        T apply(T t1, T t2);  // 2 input 1 output - same type
    }
```

- **specialized standard functional interface**
  - have to study


## Stream
- streams are wrappers around a data source, allowing us to operate with that data source and making bulk processing convenient and fast.
- stream does not store data and, in that sense, is not a data structure. 
- stream never modifies the underlying data source.
- stream is lazy and evaluates code only when required.
- basic stream -
``` 
    Stream.of(list);
    
    Stream.ofNullable(list);
    
    Stream.empty();
    
    list.stream()
        .filter(---)
        .map(---)
        .forEach(---)
```
- stream pipeline 
  - has two kinds of operation
    - intermediate operation
    - terminator operation
  - stream does not execute any intermediate operation until a terminal operation attached
  ```
      products.stream()
              .map(p -> { sout(p); return p;} );
      // this will print nothing. because map is an intermediate operation and it will not exexuted untill a terminal operatio cosumes the data
      
      products.stream()
              .map(p -> { sout(p); return p;} )
              .forEach( p -> {} );
      // this will print product list. forEach is a terminal operation. so when forEach consume data from stream, stream will execute map operation and product will be printed. 
  ```
  - intermediate operation
    - ```map(), filter(), distinct(), sorted(), limit(), skip()```
    - intermediate operation has Stream<T> return type
    - they return stream
    - they can be chained together to form a pipeline of operations
    - stream pipeline can have any number of intermediate operations
    - lazily loaded
    - they don’t produce end result
    - can't be placed after terminal operation
  - Terminal operation
    - ```forEach(), toArray(), reduce(), collect(), min(), max(), count(), anyMatch(), allMatch(), noneMatch(), findFirst(), findAny()```
    - those are non Stream<T> return type methods.
    - They return non-stream values
    - can’t be chained together
    - stream pipeline can have maximum one terminal operation
    - terminal operation is the last operation in stream pipeline
    - operations are eagerly loaded
    - produce end result
- stream pipeline can
- search in stream is terminal operation
  - ```short circuit -  findFirst()  findAny()  anyMatch()```
  - ```non short circuit -  allMatch()  noneMatch()```
