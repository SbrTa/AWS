# Chapter 9: Migration and Innovation

### AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)
AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) organizes guidance into six areas of focus, called Perspectives. Each Perspective addresses distinct responsibilities. In general, the **Business, People and Governance** Perspectives focus on business capabilities, whereas the **Platform, Security and Operations** Perspectives focus on technical capabilities.


### Migration strategies
When migrating applications to the cloud, six of the most common migration strategies that you can implement are:
  - Rehosting
    - lift-and-shift
    - moving applications without changes 
  - Replatforming
    - lift, tinker, and shift
    - involves making a few cloud optimizations to see benefits
    - Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application
  - Refactoring/re-architecting
    - Refactoring / re-architecting involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features.
    - Refactoring is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the applicationâ€™s existing environment.
  - Repurchasing
    - fresh start
    - involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model.  
  - Retaining
    - keeps applications that are critical for the business in the source environment 
    - This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.
  - Retiring
    - removing applications that are no longer needed.
