# Security

### AWS shared responsibility model
AWS is responsible for **security of the cloud** and customer is responsible for **security in the cloud**.
  - **Customer Responsibility**
      - Encryption of data
      - Server side encryption on S3
      - Customer train their own employees
      - Network and firewall config
      - Patch OS on EC2
  - **AWS Responsibility**
      - Set aws NTP server to correct time
      - Hardware management
      - Data center management
      - Physical security
      - Patching and updating hypervisor
      - Hardware and software infrastructure
      - Network infrastructure
      - Virtualization infrastructure
      - AWS trains AWS employees
  - **Shared**
      - Patch management
      - Configurations Management
      - Awareness & Training

### IAM - Identity and Access Management
  - IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
  - **AWS account root user**
    - When you first create an AWS account, you begin with an identity known as the root user 
    - Best practice
      - Do not use the root user for everyday tasks
      - Instead, use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.
      - Then, continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS. 
      - Only use the root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user.
  - **IAM users**
    - An IAM user is an identity that you create in AWS.
    - When creating IAM user, by default no permissions associated with it.
    - create individual IAM users for each person
    - Even if multiple employees require same access, create individual IAM users for each
  - **IAM policies**
    - IAM policy is a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources
    - enable you to customize users levels of access to resources
    - Follow the security principle of least privilege when granting permissions.
  - **IAM groups**
    - An IAM group is a collection of IAM users
    - When you assign an IAM policy to a group, all users in the group are granted permissions specified by the policy.
    - Assigning IAM policies at the group level also makes it easier to adjust permissions when an employee transfers to a different job
  - **IAM roles**
    - An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions.
    - IAM roles are ideal for situations in which access to services or resources needs to be granted temporarily.
  - **Multi-factor authentication**
    - multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your AWS account.

### AWS Organizations
Suppose that your company has multiple AWS accounts. You can use AWS Organizations to consolidate and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central location.
  - When you create an organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates a root, which is the parent container for all the accounts in your organization. 
  - you can centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization by using service control policies (SCPs).
  - SCPs enable you to place restrictions on the AWS services, resources, and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access.
  - SCPs affect an individual member account, or an OU.
  - Consolidated billing is another feature of AWS Organizations
  - **Organizational units**
    - you can group accounts into organizational units (OUs)
    - easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements.
    - When you apply a policy to an OU, all the accounts in the OU automatically inherit the permissions
    - easily isolate workloads or applications that have specific security requirements

### AWS Artifact
AWS Artifact is a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. AWS Artifact consists of two main sections: AWS Artifact Agreements and AWS Artifact Reports.
  - **AWS Artifact Agreements**: Suppose that your company needs to sign an agreement with AWS regarding your use of certain types of information throughout AWS services. You can do this through AWS Artifact Agreements. In AWS Artifact Agreements, you can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations. Different types of agreements are offered to address the needs of customers who are subject to specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
  - **AWS Artifact Reports**: suppose that a member of your companyâ€™s development team is building an application and needs more information about their responsibility for complying with certain regulatory standards. You can advise them to access this information in AWS Artifact Reports. AWS Artifact Reports provide compliance reports from third-party auditors. These auditors have tested and verified that AWS is compliant with a variety of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards and regulations. AWS Artifact Reports remains up to date with the latest reports released. You can provide the AWS audit artifacts to your auditors or regulators as evidence of AWS security controls. 

### Customer Compliance Center
The Customer Compliance Center contains resources to help you learn more about AWS compliance. In the Customer Compliance Center, you can read customer compliance stories to discover how companies in regulated industries have solved various compliance, governance, and audit challenges. You can also access compliance whitepapers and documentation on topics such as:
  - AWS answers to key compliance questions
  - An overview of AWS risk and compliance
  - An auditing security checklist
Additionally, the Customer Compliance Center includes an auditor learning path. This learning path is designed for individuals in auditing, compliance, and legal roles who want to learn more about how their internal operations can demonstrate compliance using the AWS Cloud.
