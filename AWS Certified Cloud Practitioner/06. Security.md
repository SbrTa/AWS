### IAM - Identity and Access Management
  - IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
  - AWS account root user
    - When you first create an AWS account, you begin with an identity known as the root user 
    - Best practice
      - Do not use the root user for everyday tasks
      - Instead, use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.
      - Then, continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS. 
      - Only use the root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user.
  - IAM users
    - An IAM user is an identity that you create in AWS.
