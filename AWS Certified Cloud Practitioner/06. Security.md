# Security

### AWS shared responsibility model
AWS is responsible for **security of the cloud** and customer is responsible for **security in the cloud**.
  - **Customer Responsibility**
      - Encryption of data
      - Server side encryption on S3
      - Customer train their own employees
      - Network and firewall config
      - Patch OS on EC2
  - **AWS Responsibility**
      - Set aws NTP server to correct time
      - Hardware management
      - Data center management
      - Physical security
      - Patching and updating hypervisor
      - Hardware and software infrastructure
      - Network infrastructure
      - Virtualization infrastructure
      - AWS trains AWS employees
  - **Shared**
      - Patch management
      - Configurations Management
      - Awareness & Training

### IAM - Identity and Access Management
  - IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
  - **AWS account root user**
    - When you first create an AWS account, you begin with an identity known as the root user 
    - Best practice
      - Do not use the root user for everyday tasks
      - Instead, use the root user to create your first IAM user and assign it permissions to create other users.
      - Then, continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS. 
      - Only use the root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user.
  - **IAM users**
    - An IAM user is an identity that you create in AWS.
    - When creating IAM user, by default no permissions associated with it.
    - create individual IAM users for each person
    - Even if multiple employees require same access, create individual IAM users for each
  - **IAM policies**
    - IAM policy is a document that allows or denies permissions to AWS services and resources
    - enable you to customize users levels of access to resources
    - Follow the security principle of least privilege when granting permissions.
  - **IAM groups**
    - An IAM group is a collection of IAM users
    - When you assign an IAM policy to a group, all users in the group are granted permissions specified by the policy.
    - Assigning IAM policies at the group level also makes it easier to adjust permissions when an employee transfers to a different job
  - **IAM roles**
    - An IAM role is an identity that you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions.
    - IAM roles are ideal for situations in which access to services or resources needs to be granted temporarily.
  - **Multi-factor authentication**
    - multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your AWS account.

### AWS Organizations
Suppose that your company has multiple AWS accounts. You can use AWS Organizations to consolidate and manage multiple AWS accounts within a central location.
  - When you create an organization, AWS Organizations automatically creates a root, which is the parent container for all the accounts in your organization. 
  - you can centrally control permissions for the accounts in your organization by using service control policies (SCPs).
  - SCPs enable you to place restrictions on the AWS services, resources, and individual API actions that users and roles in each account can access.
  - Consolidated billing is another feature of AWS Organizations
  - **Organizational units**
    - you can group accounts into organizational units (OUs)
    - easier to manage accounts with similar business or security requirements.
    - When you apply a policy to an OU, all the accounts in the OU automatically inherit the permissions
    - easily isolate workloads or applications that have specific security requirements
