# Chapter 3: Global infrastructure and reliability

### Region
A region is a geographical area. Four business factors to consider when determining the right Region 
  - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements
  - Proximity and latency
  - Available services
  - Pricing

### Availability Zones
An Availability Zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other.

### Edge locations
Edge locations are Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints for CloudFront. CloudFront uses edge locations to store cached copies of your content closer 
to your customers for faster delivery.

### How to provision AWS resources
In AWS everything is an API call, there are pre determined ways to interact with AWS services. 
There are a few options to interact with those services, for example:
  - AWS management console (web based, visually)
  - AWS Command line interface (CLI - API calls via terminal)
  - AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs - interface for different programming languages)

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB)
Elastic beanstalk (EB) is a AWS managed service that manages EC2 instances. EB provides a way of making the process repeatable and prevent the possible human error 
during deployment. You provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:
  - Adjust capacity
  - Load balancing
  - Automatic scaling
  - Application health monitoring

### AWS CloudFormation
  - CloudFormation used to provision services through XML or JSON declarative scripts called CloudFormation templates. 
  - This kind of approach of serving infrastructure on a coded basis is known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC). 
  - You can run the same CloudFormation template in multiple accounts or multiple regions, and it will create identical environments across them. 
  - **CloudFormation change set** used to preview changes to be made to an aws resourse which will be deployed using CloudFormation template.

## KEY points
  - Region is a geographical area.
  - Availability Zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region.
  - A region can have 2 or more AZ.
  - Edge locations are Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoints for CloudFront.
  - 26 region.
  - 84 AZ.
  - **300+** edge locations.
  - AWS **outposts** extend AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises data center.
