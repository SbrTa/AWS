# Storage and Database

### Instance stores
  - block-level storage
  - temporary
  - attached to EC2
  - lifespan is same as the EC2 instance
  - When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.

### EBS - Elastic Block Storage
  - block-level storage
  - persistent type
  - consistent and low-latency performance
  - If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.
  -  You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.
  -  **EBS snapshot**
    - EBS snapshot is an incremental backup
    - first backup taken of a volume copies all the data
    - For subsequent backups, only the blocks of data that have changed since the most recent snapshot are saved.
