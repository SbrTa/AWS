# Cloud Fundamentals

## Cloud computing
Simply cloud computing is the delivery of computing services — including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence — over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
### Benefits of cloud computing
  - **Scalability**: Cloud-based solutions are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your business demands increase, you can easily increase your cloud capacity without having to invest in physical infrastructure. This level of agility can give businesses using cloud computing a real advantage over competitors.
  - **Cost**: Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.
  - **Performance**: The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.
  - **Security**: Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.
  - **Speed**: Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.
  - **Productivity**: On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
  - **Reliability**: Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.
  - And many more ...

## Different Service models
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS stand for the three main categories of cloud computing. Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of different servers that host, store, manage, and process data online.
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: IaaS products allow organizations to manage their business resources — such as their network, servers, and data storage — on the cloud.
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: PaaS products allow businesses and developers to host, build, and deploy consumer-facing apps.
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: By far the most common cloud service, SaaS products offer both consumers and businesses cloud-based tools and applications for everyday use.

### AWS Well-Architected Framework
When architecting technology solutions on Amazon Web Services (AWS), if you neglect the five pillars of operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization, it can become challenging to build a system that delivers on your expectations and requirements.
  - **Operational Excellence**
    - Perform operations as code
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
    - Refine operations procedures frequently
    - Anticipate failure
    - Learn from all operational failures
  - **Security**
    - Implement a strong identity foundation
    - Enable traceability
    - Apply security at all layers
    - Automate security best practices
    - Protect data in transit and at rest
    - Keep people away from data
    - Prepare for security events
  - **Reliability**
    - Automatically recover from failure
    - Test recovery procedures
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
    - Stop guessing capacity
    - Manage change in automation
  - **Performance Efficiency**
    - Democratize advanced technologies
    - Go global in minutes
    - Use serverless architectures
    - Experiment more often
    - Consider mechanical sympathy
  - **Cost Optimization**
    - Implement cloud financial management
    - Adopt a consumption model
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
    - Analyze and attribute expenditure
